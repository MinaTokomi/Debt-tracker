A debt tracker essentially acts as a compass, providing a clear direction for navigating through the labyrinth of financial obligations. By meticulously recording and organizing various debts, including credit card dues, loans, and mortgages, it empowers individuals with a comprehensive understanding of their financial liabilities. This knowledge fosters a sense of control and accountability, allowing for informed strategies to tackle debt. Moreover, a debt tracker fosters the cultivation of responsible financial habits.  It instills discipline in adhering to payment schedules and motivates individuals to prioritize high-interest debts, curbing the accumulation of unnecessary interest burdens. By establishing a structured repayment plan, it facilitates the gradual but steady liberation from the shackles of debt, paving the way for financial freedom.
